# Prime-numbers-and-Fibonacci-sequence-Question-Lab06-FAST-1st-sem-PF-

This question was assigned to us in Lab 06 of the Programming Fundamentals course during the first semester at FAST NUCES. The task requires us to first develop a logic to check whether a number entered by the user is prime. Secondly, if the number is prime, we are required to print the Fibonacci sequence up to that number, ensuring that the last number in the sequence is smaller than or equal to the prime number entered by the user. This is a very conceptual question, as it involves both determining if a number is prime and printing the Fibonacci sequence.

7. Take user input and integrate the number if it is a prime and print the Fibonacci series till that
number.
Example
Input: 5 Output:
Number is prime
Series is = 0 1 1 2 3 5
